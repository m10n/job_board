This is the simple Rails job board I completed at the August 2015 San Francisco RailsBridge* hosted at Instacart. It contains a form for creating a new job with a title and description, a homepage listing the jobs, a show page that displays an individual job, the ability to edit or delete a job... and almost no styling.

[RailsBridge](http://railsbridge.org/) hosts a bunch of (astonishingly) free weekend coding workshops for women. You can go from absolutely no programming experience to deploying an app to GitHub & Heroku in about eight hours. If your city has a [local chapter,](http://railsbridge.org/about/chapters) I highly recommend attending, or if you're a developer, volunteering. There are worse ways to spend a Saturday.
